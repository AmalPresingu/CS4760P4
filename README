2. Run oss executable: oss [-h] [-s t] [-l f]
3. Inspect log files & screen for results
4. Run make clean

COMMANDS 
-------------------
./oss -h            Prints usage commands
./oss 				Runs with default time of 3 seconds
./oss -s t			Allows user to set maximum seconds before termination

Version Control

AGING ALGORITHM
----------------
The aging algorithm can be found on line #354. Did this by calculating
the average CPU time and average total time. Stored this as ratio and
compared the average ratio to the current ratio. If the average ratio was
greater than the current ratio, it shifts to the level 2 queue. 

ISSUES/CHANGES
--------------
- I printed the STATS to the screen and stored everything else regarding the OSS in the log file.

- I had to set the max processes to 20 instead of 50, because it killed my connection to the
  server everytime it was over 25. I think this may have something to do with how I handled
  the queues, but still not entirely sure. 20 max processes should run smooth everytime. 
  However, 50 max processes runs smoothly on my local terminal.
