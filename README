AGING ALGORITHM
----------------
The aging algorithm can be found on line #358. Did this by calculating
the average CPU time and average total time. Stored this as ratio and
compared the average ratio to the current ratio. If the average ratio was
greater than the current ratio, it shifts to the level 2 queue.
